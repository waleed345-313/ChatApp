# ChatApp
This chat application, developed by Muhammad Waleed, is a real-time messaging platform designed for seamless, user-friendly communication. Built using React Native for the frontend and Node.js with MongoDB for the backend, the app supports both individual and group chats, user authentication, contact management, and profile customization.

It integrates features like live messaging using Socket.io, secure login/signup via PHPMyAdmin (MySQL), and persistent recent chat storage using local storage or database. The user interface is professionally styled and optimized for mobile performance using stack, tab, and drawer navigation.

The goal of this application is to provide a reliable and modern chat solution with a clean interface and smooth user experience.
